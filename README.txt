Use Test.py to run tests. This python file is unchanged.
MemoryOperation.py is also unchanged.
MemoryManager.py is a class to run request/ release operations.
HashTable.py is a class to implement a two-level hash table with a secondary BST.

Before running tests, make sure to adjust the memory map size in MemoryManager.py line 25: self.total_memory = 1024 # Can be modified

Also, put the testing csv files in the folder Data. Note that the folder Data is located in the parent directory instead of the currrent directory (which contains the Python file).
